Taking 3 VPC's.
2 VPC's are same region(N.virginia) but different AZ (APP_Server_VPC for us-east-1a)(WEB_Server_VPC for us-east-1b)
1 vpc in different region(ohio) (DB_Server_VPC for us-east-2a)
How I created the VPC:
from  AWS Console-> go to vpc and more, select CIDR, region and AZ (1 public subnet, enabled public ip , no private subnet)
remember-  No IP"S should be overlapping for VPCS
Edit the deafult security group attached for all 3 vpc's, allowing all inbound traffic (Testing purpose). In real world we should give all traffic(security breach)
create 3 ec2 instances for each VPC
so,if you login now in any ec2 machine and ping other ec2 private ip- (no connection is established)

------------------------------------------------VPC PEERING STEPS--------------------------------------------------------------------------

establishing connection with in same region VPC (APP_WEB)

go to VPC -> Peering connection
requestor: app-Server
acceptor: web-Server
once the peering connection is created, we have to accept the request

go to the route tables, click routes, edit route and add destination route
ex: select the app server rt, in destination add webserver ip adress and and in target select peering connection and its id (it will be same value)
 same like this vice-versa we need to do for webserver rt:
 go to route table webserver rt, in destination add appserver ip adress and in target select peering connection and its id ((it will be same value))

 thats it you are done now :) the VPC Peering is enabled and it can ping one vpc-to other vpc in same region 
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 establishing vpc peering connections in different region VPC'S

 go to the other region ohio. 
 go to vpc -> peering connection 
 give name as : db-app
 requestor:db server
 acceptor: app server
 once the peering connection is done, here there wont be any accept request due to other region.
 we need to go to the N.virginia region and vpc -> peering connection -> there will be pending request -> accept request

 now goto each region route tables -> add destination and target (peering connection id)
the peering connenction is established now between db and app and app to db
