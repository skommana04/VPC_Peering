Taking 3 VPC's.
2 VPC's are same region(N.virginia) but different AZ (APP_Server_VPC for us-east-1a)(WEB_Server_VPC for us-east-1b)
1 vpc in different region(ohio) (DB_Server_VPC for us-east-2a)
How I created the VPC:
from  AWS Console-> go to vpc and more, select CIDR, region and AZ (1 public subnet, enabled public ip , no private subnet)
remember-  No IP"S should be overlapping for VPCS
Edit the deafult security group attached for all 3 vpc's, allowing all inbound traffic (Testing purpose). In real world we should give all traffic(security breach)
create 3 ec2 instances for each VPC
so,if you login now in any ec2 machine and ping other ec2 private ip- (no connection is established)

------------------------------------------------VPC PEERING STEPS--------------------------------------------------------------------------

establishing connection with in same region VPC (APP_WEB)

go to VPC -> Peering connection
requestor: app-Server
acceptor: web-Server
once the peering connection is created, we have to accept the request
